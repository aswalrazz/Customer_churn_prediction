Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning in Python
 
Overview
Customer Churn Prediction is a Python-based machine learning project designed to predict whether a customer will churn (leave) based on historical data. It uses algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to analyze features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and subscription details. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. This can be used by businesses to identify at-risk customers and implement retention strategies.
Features

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
Model Training: Train multiple ML models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Model Evaluation: Assess performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV for optimizing model parameters.
Visualizations: Generate confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance plots.
Prediction: Make predictions on new data.
Modular Code: Easy-to-extend structure for adding more models or features.

Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Jupyter Notebook or Python environment for running scripts.

Setup

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction


Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt



Requirements
Create a requirements.txt file with the following:
pandas==2.0.3
numpy==1.24.3
scikit-learn==1.3.0
xgboost==1.7.6
matplotlib==3.7.2
seaborn==0.12.2
jupyter==1.0.0

Usage

Prepare Data: Place your dataset (e.g., churn_data.csv) in the data/ folder. The dataset should include features like tenure, monthly_charges, contract_type, and a target column churn (Yes/No).

Run the Notebook/Script:

If using Jupyter: jupyter notebook churn_prediction.ipynb
Or run the Python script: python churn_prediction.py


Train Models:

The script loads data, preprocesses it, splits into train/test sets, trains models, and evaluates them.
Example output: Model accuracies, confusion matrices, and saved models (e.g., best_model.pkl).


Make Predictions:

Load the trained model and predict on new data:import pickle
import pandas as pd

model = pickle.load(open('best_model.pkl', 'rb'))
new_data = pd.DataFrame({...})  # Your new customer data
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
print(predictions)





Example
Assume a dataset with columns: customer_id, gender, senior_citizen, tenure, monthly_charges, total_charges, contract, payment_method, churn.

Load and preprocess: Handle categoricals with one-hot encoding, scale numerics.
Train: XGBoost achieves 85% accuracy.
Visualize: Feature importance shows tenure and monthly_charges as top predictors.
Predict: For a new customer with high monthly charges and short tenure, predict 'Yes' (churn).
